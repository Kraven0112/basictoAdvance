A class in java is fundamental building block of object-oriented programming. It is also known as a blue print for creating the object and defines properties (attributes) and behavior (methods) that the object created from the class will have.

// format of class in java programming

class class_name{
    
}

we use pascal naming convention when creating class in java and for method we generally use camel naming convention in java. 

Pascal naming convention => class FibonacciSeries{

    camel naming convention => public int totalSum(int a, int b){

    }
} 

In java object is instance of class or also known as reference variable. Without class we can't create an object. JVM helps to create object in java programming.
