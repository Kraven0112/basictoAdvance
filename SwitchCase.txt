Switch case in java is an alternative feature to execute one block of code according to the case or condition.

There are different way to use switch as a statement and as an expression.

1. Traditional way to use switch-case in java:

switch (){
    case 1:
    //
    break;

    case 2:
    //
    break;

    default:
    //
    break;
}



2. Using lambda expression in switch case:
String result = ";

result = switch(){
    case 1 -> "happy";
    case 2 -> "sad";
    case 3 -> "scared";
    default -> "Nothing happening";
};





3.Using yield in switch-case expession:

String result = "";

result = switch (){
    case 1 : yield "happy";
    case 2 : yield "sad";
    case 3 : yield "scared";
    default : yield "Nothing happened";
};

Using lambda expession and yield in switch case make code explicit and concise which can be more readable .
