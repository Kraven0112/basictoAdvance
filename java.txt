 What is Java ?
=> A java is a high-level object oriented programming language. It was developed by Sun Microsytem (now owned by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995.

Why java is known as platform independent language?
=> A java is platform independent language because the code written in java can run in any device which has Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

What does Automatic Memory Management means in java ?
=> Means java has a built-in garbage collector that automatically manages memory, helping to prevent memory leaks and other related issues.

What is multithreading in java ?
=> Java supports multithreadng allowing concurrent execution of two or more threads, which can improve performance of application.


What is Java sandbox?
=> Java sandbox is a built-in security feature which helps to protect against malicious code.

What are the uses of Java program ?
=> Java is used in web development, Mobile Application, Enterprise Application, Desktop Application, Embedded Systems, Game Development, Big Data Technologies, Cloud Computing, etc.

What is JVM ?
=> It stands for Java Virtual Machine which helps us to execute of java bytecode, platform independent, memory management, security, performance optimization, exception handling, Thread Management, Interoperability, debugging and profing.JVM is a part of Java Virtual Machine.


What is java bytecode ?
=> Java bytecode is a intermediate representation of java source code compiled java compiler.

What is JIT in JVM ?
=> JIT stands for Just-In-Time compilation which is important feature of JVM  and compiles bytecode into native machine code at runtime which helps to improve the performance of java application.


What is JRE ?
=> JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is part of Java Development Kit which provides necessary environment to run java application.

What is JDK ?
=> JDK stands for Java Development Kit which provides the tools and resources for developers to create, compile and run java application.

JVM with libraries is part of JRE and JRE is a part of JDK.

There are four access modifier in java which are public, private, default and protected.

Public => It helps to access from any class in any package.

Protected => It helps to access within same package and also by subclasses even if they are in different package.

default => It helps to access only within its own package.

private => It helps to access only within its own class.

JVM only understands bytecode which intermediate representation of java source code compiled by java compiler.

In java it needs main method for compilation and run of the entire program.

Java is WORA means Write Once and Run Anywhere.

We have to know why we build software => We build software to solve the problem. We use to solve the real world problems using virtual world.

We use to solve real world problems using virtual world because the data, which plays most important role in problem solving.

When we take data from users we do process on it and store permanently in database , also we can store data temporarily in variables.


Primitive data with specific range and sze:
byte => size: 8 bits (1 byte)
        range: -128 to 127

short => size: 16 bits (2 bytes)
        range: -32768 to 32767

int => size: 32 bits (4 bytes)
        range: -2147483648 to 2147483647

long => size: 64 bits (8 bytes)
        range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807

float => size: 32 bits (4 bytes)
        range: Approximately ±3.40282347E+38 (6-7 significant decimal digits)

double => size: 64 bits (8 bytes)
        range: Approximately ±1.79769313486231570E+308 (15 significant decimal digits)

char => size: 16 bits (2 bytes)
        range: 0 to 65,535 (Unicode characters)

boolean => size: 1 bit
        value : true or false

Primitive data types are the foundation of the programming language.

Java is known as object oriented programming because everything in java should be an object. And object can be created using class.

Java compiler is a part of JDK not JVM. But JIT is part of JVM. 

UTF => It is known as Unicode Transformation Format.

Java program uses unicode not ascii code.

Literals defines constant value of any variables in java. Like 
int num = 20;
 int number = 0b101; which is 5 inetger.


 Binary in java = 0b
 Hexadecimal in java = 0x
 Octal in java = 0

 There are two types of conversion in java:
 1.Implicit conversion: It means widening
 2.Explicit conversion: It means narrowing and it is also type casting.

 There are some conversion that we can't do in java like char to boolean, int to boolean.

 When we use / divide symbol, we get quotient and when we use % modular symbol, we get remainder.

 There are four types of operators in programming language:
 Arithmetic operators 
 Relational operators
 Logical operators
 Bitwise operators
 Assignment Operator { = is assignment operator}
 Ternary operators => It is short form of if-else statement


 ++num -> This is known as pre-increment, which increment value first then fetch value. 
 --num -> This is known as pre-decrement, which decrement value first then fetch value.

 num++ -> This is known as post=increment, which fetch value then increment the value.
 num-- -> This is known as post-decrement, which fetch value then decrement the value.
